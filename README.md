- üç∏ More Go and Rust please.I love languages, they may
  have the same syntax but the ideas behind its is brilliantly
  different. Therefore, I use various of languages in my daily
  developer's life for each scenarios.
- ü¶• For me, Go (Gin), NodeJS (Express), Python (FastAPI) and
  PHP (Lavravel) are working properly for small,
  and medium web apps which need to optimize time of development.
  For much larger one, I often choose Java (Spring).
- üç± Rust, C and Zig are the great choices for system apps which
  need high-performance, low latency (cause by garbage collector),
  and high throughput.
- üçå I'm working in deep learning too so Python.
- üåà Neovim is like my girl friend, I talk with it every day.
  Therefore, I spend huge amount of time to configure and write
  plugin for it. You may want to check
  [Nguyen-Hoang-Nam/nvim-dotfiles-kitty](https://github.com/Nguyen-Hoang-Nam/nvim-dotfiles-kitty).
- üå≥ Recently, I use Haskell to solve problems in CodeWar and turn out
  it's really nice. I think I'm falling love with it.
