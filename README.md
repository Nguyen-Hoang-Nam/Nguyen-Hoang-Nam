- üöÄ Optimization and performance are my main goal when design
  any architectures. To make this possible, I use Go and Rust
  which are great tools because of their self-optimization.
- üõ∞ Most of the time, I work as a full-stack web developer.
  Building microservices backend in Java, Go, Nodejs, Python
  in the daytime and create React app at night.
- üç± At my free time, I do all of weird stuffs. Playing with 
  Haskell in Codewar, creating mobile app in Flutter, building
  machine learing project in Python or playing with Web 3
- üå≥ While I can play with IDE, I still stick with Neovim as
  my main text editor, because it always suprises me by how
  much it can do and how efficent it is.
